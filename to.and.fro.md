# Watch television from the browser. Period.

## Welcome

    I believe everyone deserves to watch a bit of tele. My goal is to remove any technical barrier that can prevent 
    you from doing so.


## About

Tele Lollo is a super simple website that, by using today's technologies, can stream tv.

And, it doesn't store any video file. 

The website simply soft-codes a few external links to publicly available video stream URLs, 
which, to the best of my knowledge, have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. 

The selection of channels (external links .m3u8) is sourced from https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv

If any link infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, 
please [open an issue](https://github.com/farina00/tele.lollo/issues) and I will remove it. 

## Chronicle

- In 1995, the term [IPTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television#History) first appeared 
- In 2009, [HTTP Live Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) was released 
- In 2021, [Tele Lollo](https://farina00.github.io/tele.lollo) was created (broadcasting only a selection of italian channels)

## Terms And Conditions

In fact, I would love for you to use this website.
If you enjoy you can also tell others about how great it is. 
But, heads up, I can't guarantee that the channels will always be up.
And if they are not, you have got to live with that.

## About Tele Lollo

[Tele Lollo](https://farina00.github.io/tele.lollo) is a super simple website that, by using today's technologies, can stream tv.

And, it doesn't store any video file. 

The website simply soft-codes a few external links to publicly available video stream URLs, 
which, to the best of my knowledge, have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. 

The selection of channels - external links to m3u8 files - is sourced from https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv

If any link infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, 
please [open an issue](https://github.com/farina00/tele.lollo/issues) and I will remove it. 


## Chronicle

- In 1995, the term [IPTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television#History) first appeared 
- In 2009, [HTTP Live Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) was released 
- In 2021, [Tele Lollo](https://farina00.github.io/tele.lollo) was created (broadcasting only a selection of italian channels) 


## Technologies

I would have not been able to build Tele Lollo without leaning on other people's work, tools and technologies.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - Since Tele Lollo is a Web App not a native App 
- [HTTP Live Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) - The protocol to stream the television channels
- [m3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) - The file format for playlist to stream
- [iptv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television) - The protocol to have television over IP
- [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) - Awesome JavaScript library to implement an HTTP Live Streaming client
- [terser.js](https://github.com/terser/terser) - to reduce load times and bandwidth 
- [HTML-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier) - to reduce load times and bandwidth
- [cloudfare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) - The CDN for some of the JavaScript resources
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - The web hosting service
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The IDE I have been using to write Tele Lollo

A curated list of a few publicly available IPTV channels

The IPTV channels are sourced from https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv

## Legal

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply soft-codes a few links to publicly available video stream URLs (see https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv), which to the best of my knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by opening an issue. Obviously just removing the link from here will not remove its contents from the web.
